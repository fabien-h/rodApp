		<h2>A few words about "republican or democrat"</h2>

		<p>This small application is a replica of <a href="http://degaucheoudedroite.fr/">this other one</a> I made 2 years ago about the french Parliament.</p>

		<p>I made this new one for two reasons. First to try a little bit a wonderful javascript framework, <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">meteor</a> (I'll put the source code on github and make a little screen cast to explain how it's made). And secondly because it'll be fun to see if we obtain the same results than with the french congressmen.</p>

		<h2>The data source</h2>

		<p>All the Datas for the app are from Wikipedia. They were accurate January 18 2014 and may not be when you are reading theses lines. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_members_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives">The list</a> of the current members of the house.
